# oryol-delaunay

An implementation of constrained delaunay triangulation in C++ (on top of Oryol::Core data structures)
* The face/halfedge structs are based on the [GDC2017 BRep data structure][1] by Gino Van Den Bergen
* Overall implementation strategy follows the algorithm in the [Kallman Geometric Modelling Paper][2]

The default application (Delaunay) is a no-frills test bed with a basic pathfinder implementation.
